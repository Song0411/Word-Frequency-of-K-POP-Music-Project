A Study on the Discrepancies in Word Frequencies of Male and Female K-POP Groups' Title Tracks

Yeawon Yoo et al. (2017) found that the words "love" and "heart," which evoke romantic love, were the most commonly used expressions in K-pop songs from 1964 to 2012.  Jo, W., & Kim, M. J. (2023) discovered that the positive emotional content increased and the negative emotional content declined in K-POP music lyrics. However, few scholars divided artists into two groups according to their gender to do quantitive research about the lyrics. 
Based on my personal experience of watching Korean dramas, the characters in male-dominated dramas focus on power, and the characters in female-dominated dramas focus on romance. So, would there be such a significant difference in the songs of K-POP male and female groups?
The question of my study was: what significant differences exist in word frequency and thematic content between the lyrics of male and female K-POP group title tracks?
Examining such differences provides a unique way to gain insight into the distinctive features and thematic elements within this musical genre. This analysis aims to reveal underlying patterns that may reflect gender-specific narratives, cultural influences, or audience interactions.
I believe I need to explore this in six steps, starting with data collection, then pre-processing the text, doing word frequency analysis and statistical analysis, and finally providing an in-depth interpretation of significant differences.
The main data I need to collect is the lyrics text data, which is available from GitHub. In order to study this, I may need to use tools such as NLTK, Python, and so on.
